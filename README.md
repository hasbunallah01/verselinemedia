## ☁️ Deploy to Vercel

The fastest path:

1. Push the repo to GitHub (already done in this repo).
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).
3. Import this repository (`hasbunallah01/thebookcrew`).
4. Vercel auto-detects Next.js — leave the defaults.
5. Click **Deploy**. Done.

Or via the Vercel CLI:

npm i -g vercel
vercel              # first-time setup, follow prompts
vercel --prod       # production deploy
```

## ✏️ Adding content

All content lives in `data/` as typed TS files. To add a new featured author:

```ts
// data/authors.ts
export const authors: Author[] = [
  // ...existing
  {
    id: "new-author",
    name: "Jane Doe",
    book: "The Quiet Hours",
    genre: "Literary Fiction",
    summary: "...",
    quote: "...",
    tags: ["Resilience", "Family"],
    image: "/images/authors/jane.jpg",
    articleUrl: "/articles/jane-doe",
  },
];
```

The home page picks it up automatically.
